Project Purpose:

We are porting the iProlog code into a C++ Verison.

We want to be able run prolog code using C++ engine.


Currently main code is the main.cpp to run the code yo can just
c++ compiler to compile the main.cpp

Current Progress:

IntList: Done

IntStack: Done

IntMap: Done

Clause: Done

Spline: Done

IMap: Need to Work On (Mid) Need to be done by 11/11

Toks: Need to Work On (Hardish/ more tedious) 11/11

Engine: Need to Work On (Need to finish other first) 11/25

Prog: Need to Work On (Need to finish the other first) 11/25

ObStack: Done (Vector provide all the functions ie pop_back/push_back/back)


Current Task:
Complete IMap file. Determine to adopt a new group into our group

Work Order:
IMap -> Toks -> Engine -> Prog
